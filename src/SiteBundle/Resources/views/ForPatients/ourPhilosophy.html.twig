						<label class="lead">We believe these results are achieved through:</label>
						<li>Strong relationships between primary care providers and patients</li>
						<li>Following evidence-based care guidelines</li>
						<li>Providing care coordination services for patients to help them better navigate the complexity of healthcare and achieve their health goals</li>
						<li>Collaborating, coordinating and communicating within a tightly integrated community of care providers</li>
						<li>Obtaining, analyzing, and leveraging clinical and quality data for better health outcomes</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Our providers understand the importance of taking time to provide value-based care for each patient.</p>
					<p>When healthcare providers focus on quality rather than quantity, this results in effective care for each patient and much more efficient use of financial resources.</p>
